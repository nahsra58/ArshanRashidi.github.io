        <p>Hi, my name is Arshan Rashidi and i don't have much experience in the coding world besides a little bit of python, I have always been into computers though and ended up building my own. So now i'm more interested in getting&nbsp; into the software aspect as well. My hobbies include playing ultimate Frisbee, walking my dog, occasionally hiking with friends, and attempting snowboarding in the winter time. I made this page about dogs to really show how good of companians they can be and how much love they can bring.</p>
        <p>My hopes are that this can show another side of this furry friends, especially since many people misunderstand them.</p>
