        <p>Hi, my name is Arshan Rashidi and i don't have much experience in the coding world besides a little bit of python, I have always been into computers though and ended up building my own. So now i'm more interested in getting  into the software aspect as well. My hobbies include playing ultimate Frisbee, walking my dog, occasionally hiking with friends, and attempting snowboarding in the winter time. In my free time I like to play video games or watch TV.

                My hopes in this class are to get a basis of general coding basics that i can expand off of.</p>
