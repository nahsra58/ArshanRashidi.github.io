<h2>Motion Detection (python)</h2>
<figure><img src=

alt="Info">
<p>Using python, I developed a program to detect and show the motion across several images 
    or frames of a video. As we feed each image, our program computes which pixels of the image have one of the 3 color 
    channels that are outside the  𝜇±𝜅𝜎  interval, where  𝜇  is the average,  
    𝜎  is the standard deviation, and  𝜅  is a parameter; we will use  𝜅=4  in our experiments, 
    thus detecting motion if values deviate from the average by more than 4 standard deviations. 
    The result is a  ℎ×𝑤×𝑐  boolean matrix filled with True/False values. If the motion detection
    contains more than 500 motion pixels, it puts the detection, and the index of the image, into a list of results.

<p>2Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry standard dummy text
ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
